Run with python index.py

This will start an interactive session on the command line so you can perform live queries.

Things you need to specify to perform a search:
	(1) query - unlimited text input
	(2) # of results - default is 10
	(3) whether you want to search conjunctively or disjunctively

*** If index has not been created or needs modified, uncomment line 114 in main to run:

	line 114: index_docs("files", "indexdir", True)

	- where files is the name of the directory that holds all of your documents i.e. your corpus

	- indexdir is the name of the index directory (doesn't have to be created yet)

	- and the Boolean represents whether or not the index already exists. Change to False if you want to re-index an existing dataset that has been modified.

*** If the index already exists, line 114 should be commented out.


Functions:

def get_schema(): - returns the schema for the index

def add_doc(writer, path): - adds a document to the index. called by both new_index() and incremental_index()

def new_index(filesdir, indexdir): - creates a new index. never call directly - this will be called by index_docs() if necessary.

def incremental_index(indexdir): - re-indexes documents on an already existing index. Will update documents if the modification time has changed, or if documents have been addded to or removed from the corpus.

def index_docs(filesdir, indexdir, clean=False): - this is what you call to index documents. See lines 10 - 20 in the readme for an explanation. This is the only function that the user may need to modify in main.

def search(indexdir, query): - searches the index for a specific query. Main is set up so user can search for queries through the command line but you could also hardcode queries by calling this in main with specific query.

def index_size(indexdir): - returns the size of the index.
